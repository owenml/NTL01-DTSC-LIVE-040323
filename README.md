# Guided Git GIF-Stravaganza! DS-040323

Today's challenge is to contribute to a Git repository, using branches and pull requests! We'll be using a Git branching workflow to all contribute to this README file.

## Steps

1. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository (should be an email sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account - will be sent out at the start of the Guided Session.
2. Clone down this repository (**don't fork it!**) to a good place on your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local repository (I recommend naming your branch after yourself, so my branch is named _david_)
4. Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling today
5. Use Markdown syntax and a text editor to add the GIF or image to this README.md file **under your name**
6. Add and commit your local changes to your branch
7. Push **your branch** to this repository (this step will not work if you forgot to checkout a branch in step 2!)
8. Start a pull request for me to review

I will either accept your pull request, or send you feedback on what you need to do to improve!

### Written Instructions to Connect to This Repository (update):

1. FORK this repository, creating a copy on your own GitHub account

2. Then clone your fork down to your local computer
```
git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/NTL01-DTSC-LIVE-040323.git
```

3. Add the `/flatiron-school/` version as the `upstream` (to pull future changes)
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/flatiron-school/NTL01-DTSC-LIVE-040323.git
```

4. You can make changes to the notebooks now! Remember to push your changes to your forked version of the repo (to put your local changes up online):
```
git add [filename]
git commit -m 'message here'
git push
```

### Whenever you want to get updated notes:

5. Grab the changes from the upstream repo
```
git fetch upstream
```

6. Merge new changes onto your local repo
```
git merge upstream/main -m "meaningful message about what you're updating"
```
>>>>>>> upstream/main
